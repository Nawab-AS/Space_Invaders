# Space Invaders
This game is a Hill Climb Racing clone (with some twists) made by Nawab_AS using processing java

## How to download
First you will need to download processing 4 ([link for download](https://processing.org/download])). Then download the source code as a .zip file, unzip the file, and open Space_Invaders.pde in processing. Click the play button and enjoy!

## Controls
use yours right and left arrow keys to move your spaceship. Additionally, you can customize the controls, something that many games lack (Keyboard only, no Xbox/Playstation/Nintendo controller support).

## Aditional notes
All artwork in this project was drawn (not created) by me with heavy inspiration from the original space invaders game.
